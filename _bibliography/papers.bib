  abstract = "Focal cortical dysplasia is a congenital abnormality of cortical
              development and the leading cause of surgically remediable
              drug-resistant epilepsy in children. Post-surgical outcome is
              improved by presurgical lesion detection on structural MRI.
              Automated computational techniques have improved detection of
              focal cortical dysplasias in adults but have not yet been
              effective when applied to developing brains. There is therefore a
              need to develop reliable and sensitive methods to address the
              particular challenges of a paediatric cohort. We developed a
              classifier using surface-based features to identify focal
              abnormalities of cortical development in a paediatric cohort. In
              addition to established measures, such as cortical thickness,
              grey-white matter blurring, FLAIR signal intensity, sulcal depth
              and curvature, our novel features included complementary metrics
              of surface morphology such as local cortical deformation as well
              as post-processing methods such as the ``doughnut'' method -
              which quantifies local variability in cortical morphometry/MRI
              signal intensity, and per-vertex interhemispheric asymmetry. A
              neural network classifier was trained using data from 22 patients
              with focal epilepsy (mean age = 12.1 $\pm$ 3.9, 9 females), after
              intra- and inter-subject normalisation using a population of 28
              healthy controls (mean age = 14.6 $\pm$ 3.1, 11 females).
              Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to quantify classifier
              sensitivity using established features and the combination of
              established and novel features. Focal cortical dysplasias in our
              paediatric cohort were correctly identified with a higher
              sensitivity (73\%) when novel features, based on our approach for
              detecting local cortical changes, were included, when compared to
              the sensitivity using only established features (59\%). These
              methods may be applicable to aiding identification of subtle
              lesions in medication-resistant paediatric epilepsy as well as to
              the structural analysis of both healthy and abnormal cortical
              development.",

              postsurgical seizure-freedom. We developed an open-source

              generalises across a heterogeneous multicentre cohort of children
              and adults, and (3) generates individualised predictions for

              patients with HS, 90 disease controls with focal cortical
              dysplasia, and 121 healthy controls) from four epilepsy centres
              in the UK, North America, and China. We used the open-source
              software HippUnfold to extract morphological surface-based
              features and volumes of the hippocampus from T1w MRI scans. We
              compared pathological hippocampal morphology in patients with HS
              to normative growth charts generated from healthy controls, and
              to the contralateral hippocampi in patients with HS. HS was
              characterised by decreased volume, thickness and gyrification as
              well as increased mean and intrinsic curvature. A logistic
              regression classifier trained on these features detected 90.1\%
              of HS patients, and accurately lateralised 97.4\% of the HS
              cohort. Crucially, in patients with MRI-negative
              histopathologically confirmed HS, the classifier detected HS in
              79.2\% (19/24) and accurately lateralised the lesions in 91.7\%
              (22/24). The Automated and Interpretable Detection of Hippocampal
              Sclerosis classifier (AID-HS) was packaged into an open-source
              pipeline, which detects and lateralises HS and generates
              individualised patient reports that characterise hippocampal
              developmental abnormalities.AID-HS is capable of accurately
              detecting and lateralising HS in a large, heterogeneous,
              multi-centre, cohort of paediatric and adult patients with
              diagnostically challenging HS. Moreover, by offering transparent,
              robust and interpretable results, AID-HS can support the
              presurgical evaluation of patients with suspected TLE.",

               drug-resistant focal epilepsy, which can be cured by surgery.
               These lesions are extremely subtle and often missed even by
               expert neuroradiologists. ``Ground truth'' manual lesion masks
               are therefore expensive, limited and have large inter-rater
               variability. Existing FCD detection methods are limited by high
               numbers of false positive predictions, primarily due to vertex-
               or patch-based approaches that lack whole-brain context. Here,
               we propose to approach the problem as semantic segmentation
               using graph convolutional networks (GCN), which allows our model
               to learn spatial relationships between brain regions. To address
               the specific challenges of FCD identification, our proposed
               model includes an auxiliary loss to predict distance from the
               lesion to reduce false positives and a weak supervision
               classification loss to facilitate learning from uncertain lesion
               masks. On a multi-centre dataset of 1015 participants with
               surface-based features and manual lesion masks from structural
               MRI data, the proposed GCN achieved an AUC of 0.74, a
               significant improvement against a previously used vertex-wise
               multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier (AUC 0.64). With
               sensitivity thresholded at 67\%, the GCN had a specificity of
               71\% in comparison to 49\% when using the MLP. This improvement
               in specificity is vital for clinical integration of
               lesion-detection tools into the radiological workflow, through
               increasing clinical confidence in the use of AI radiological

              organization are challenged by reliance on incompatible
              measurement methods at different spatial scales. Macroscale
              features such as cortical folding and functional activation are
              accessed through spatially dense neuroimaging maps, whereas
              microscale cellular and molecular features are typically measured
              with sparse postmortem sampling. Here, we integrate these
              distinct windows on brain organization by building upon existing
              postmortem data to impute, validate and analyze a library of
              spatially dense neuroimaging-like maps of human cortical gene
              expression. These maps allow spatially unbiased discovery of
              cortical zones with extreme transcriptional profiles or unusually
              rapid transcriptional change which index distinct microstructure
              and predict neuroimaging measures of cortical folding and
              functional activation. Modules of spatially coexpressed genes

              biomedical imaging is algorithm interpretability. A key
              application is the identification of subtle epileptogenic focal
              cortical dysplasias (FCDs) from structural MRI. FCDs are
              difficult to visualize on structural MRI but are often amenable
              to surgical resection. We aimed to develop an open-source,
              interpretable, surface-based machine-learning algorithm to
              automatically identify FCDs on heterogeneous structural MRI data
              from epilepsy surgery centres worldwide. The Multi-centre
              Epilepsy Lesion Detection (MELD) Project collated and harmonized
              a retrospective MRI cohort of 1015 participants, 618 patients
              with focal FCD-related epilepsy and 397 controls, from 22
              epilepsy centres worldwide. We created a neural network for FCD
              detection based on 33 surface-based features. The network was
              trained and cross-validated on 50\% of the total cohort and
              tested on the remaining 50\% as well as on 2 independent test
              sites. Multidimensional feature analysis and integrated gradient
              saliencies were used to interrogate network performance. Our
              pipeline outputs individual patient reports, which identify the
              location of predicted lesions, alongside their imaging features
              and relative saliency to the classifier. On a restricted
              'gold-standard' subcohort of seizure-free patients with FCD type
              IIB who had T1 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI data,

              Across the entire withheld test cohort the sensitivity was 59\%

              lesions, to account for uncertainty around the borders of

               external validation of a machine learning model trained to
               predict post-operative seizure outcome. METHODS: We performed a
               retrospective cohort study of 797 children who had undergone
               resective or disconnective epilepsy surgery at a tertiary
               center. We extracted patient information from medical records
               and trained three models - a logistic regression, a multilayer
               perceptron, and an XGBoost model - to predict one-year
               post-operative seizure outcome on our dataset. We evaluated the
               performance of a recently published XGBoost model on the same

               model performance, using learning curve analysis to estimate
               performance at samples up to N=2,000. Finally, we examined the
               impact of predictor selection on model performance. RESULTS: Our
               logistic regression achieved an accuracy of 72\% (95\%
               CI=68-75\%,AUC=0.72), while our multilayer perceptron and
               XGBoost both achieved accuracies of 71\% (95\% CIMLP

               own =0.70). There was no significant difference in performance
               between our three models (all P>0.4) and they all performed
               better than the external XGBoost, which achieved an accuracy of
               63\% (95\% CI=59-67\%,AUC=0.62; PLR =0.005,PMLP =0.01,PXGBoost

               current sample. The best model performance was achieved with
               data-driven feature selection. SIGNIFICANCE: We show that
               neither the deployment of complex machine learning models nor
               the assembly of thousands of patients alone is likely to
               generate significant improvements in our ability to predict

              20-micrometer isotropic resolution (BigBrain), using a
              convolutional neural network to segment, automatically, the
              cortical layers in both hemispheres. Our approach overcomes many
              of the historical challenges with measurement of histological
              thickness in 2D, and the resultant laminar atlas provides an
              unprecedented level of precision and detail. We utilized this
              BigBrain cortical atlas to test whether previously reported
              thickness gradients, as measured by MRI in sensory and motor
              processing cortices, were present in a histological atlas of
              cortical thickness and which cortical layers were contributing to
              these gradients. Cortical thickness increased across sensory
              processing hierarchies, primarily driven by layers III, V, and
              VI. In contrast, motor-frontal cortices showed the opposite
              pattern, with decreases in total and pyramidal layer thickness
              from motor to frontal association cortices. These findings
              illustrate how this laminar atlas will provide a link between
              single-neuron morphology, mesoscale cortical layering,
              macroscopic cortical thickness, and, ultimately, functional
              neuroanatomy.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Drug-resistant focal epilepsy is often caused by
               focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs). The distribution of these
               lesions across the cerebral cortex and the impact of lesion
               location on clinical presentation and surgical outcome are
               largely unknown. We created a neuroimaging cohort of patients
               with individually mapped FCDs to determine factors associated
               with lesion location and predictors of postsurgical outcome.
               METHODS: The MELD (Multi-centre Epilepsy Lesion Detection)
               project collated a retrospective cohort of 580 patients with
               epilepsy attributed to FCD from 20 epilepsy centers worldwide.
               Magnetic resonance imaging-based maps of individual FCDs with
               accompanying demographic, clinical, and surgical information
               were collected. We mapped the distribution of FCDs, examined for
               associations between clinical factors and lesion location, and
               developed a predictive model of postsurgical seizure freedom.
               RESULTS: FCDs were nonuniformly distributed, concentrating in
               the superior frontal sulcus, frontal pole, and temporal pole.
               Epilepsy onset was typically before the age of 10 years. Earlier
               epilepsy onset was associated with lesions in primary sensory
               areas, whereas later epilepsy onset was associated with lesions
               in association cortices. Lesions in temporal and occipital lobes
               tended to be larger than frontal lobe lesions. Seizure freedom
               rates varied with FCD location, from around 30\% in visual,
               motor, and premotor areas to 75\% in superior temporal and
               frontal gyri. The predictive model of postsurgical seizure
               freedom had a positive predictive value of 70\% and negative
               predictive value of 61\%. SIGNIFICANCE: FCD location is an
               important determinant of its size, the age at epilepsy onset,
               and the likelihood of seizure freedom postsurgery. Our atlas of
               lesion locations can be used to guide the radiological search
               for subtle lesions in individual patients. Our atlas of regional
               seizure freedom rates and associated predictive model can be
               used to estimate individual likelihoods of postsurgical seizure
               freedom. Data-driven atlases and predictive models are essential
               for evidence-based, precision medicine and risk counseling in
               epilepsy.",
