Hello! I'm Konrad and I lead the IMAGINE Lab.

Together we use machine learning to create the imaging and genetics tools to better understand, diagnose and target treatment in neurodevelopmental disorders, with a particular focus on epilepsy.

My background is in medicine, physics, neuroimaging, genetics and machine learning.

At the weekend I love spending time outdoors with my family.
