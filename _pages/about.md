Welcome to the IMAGINE Lab! We are based at the [School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis) and [UCL's Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/research/developmental-neurosciences). We work on building imaging and genetics tools to better understand, diagnose and treat neurodevelopmental disorders.

Read more about our research projects [here](/al-folio/projects/)

Meet our [team](/al-folio/profiles/).




Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
